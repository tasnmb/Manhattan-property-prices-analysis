### Description


At university for the Big Data module, we were tasked with creating a machine learning model that uses a Manhattan properties dataset. This model will then be used to create predictions on future sale prices of properties if given data such as location, amount of bedrooms etc. 


This project showcased our skills in data visualisation and cleaning, along with the ability to make a good machine learning model that can successfully predict sale prices to a high enough accuracy (98%).


The way we cleaned our data and performed data visualisation, as well as model building can be seen on the "big_data_cw_part_2_1.ipynb" file.
